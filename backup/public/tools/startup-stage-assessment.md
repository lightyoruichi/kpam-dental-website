## Startup Stage Framework

### Stage 1: Idea Sharpness & Urgent Validation
**Goal:** One-line clarity + behavior-backed urgency

**Must-Do Tasks:**
- [ ] **One-liner test:** Clear, boring sentence (no adjectives, no fluff)
- [ ] **Urgency test:** Who loses money/time right now without this?
- [ ] **Channel check:** Know where you'll find early users
- [ ] **Behavior proof:** User booked call, shared data, signed up, or paid
- [ ] **False positive guard:** Avoid "cool idea" responses, look for "take my money"

**Stage 1 Checkpoint (Gate):**
‚úÖ One-liner passes the "mom test"
‚úÖ Urgency validated via user behavior (not survey)
‚úÖ Either MVP tested OR 2-3 LOIs signed
‚úÖ First channel hypothesis mapped

**üö´ Kill or pivot if:** Users don't engage without prompts. Validation = compliments, not actions.

---

### Stage 2: MVP ‚Üí Actual Product-Market Fit
**Goal:** Users use and come back. They'd be pissed if you shut it down.

**Must-Do Tasks:**
- [ ] **Launch MVP fast:** ‚â§30 days from idea or you're stalling
- [ ] **Track activation:** Define "aha moment" and build flow to get users there fast
- [ ] **User love test:** Get 5-10 users who voluntarily give feedback, re-engage weekly, and refer
- [ ] **Retention tracking:** 7-day and 30-day retention (cohort chart or it didn't happen)
- [ ] **Do unscalable onboarding:** Calls, walkthroughs, direct support

**Stage 2 Checkpoint (Gate):**
‚úÖ MVP live
‚úÖ 5-10 highly engaged users
‚úÖ Measurable activation + retention metrics
‚úÖ Users refer or use without prompts

**üö´ Kill or pivot if:** Users drop after 1 use. Zero organic referrals. Feedback is vague or absent.

---

### Stage 3: Repeatable Traction & Early Growth
**Goal:** Growth engine that works without founder grinding every trial.

**Must-Do Tasks:**
- [ ] **Define NSM (North Star Metric):** MRR, WAU, VMAC‚Äîwhatever matters
- [ ] **Build growth funnel:** Track Visit ‚Üí Signup ‚Üí Activation ‚Üí Retention ‚Üí Paid
- [ ] **Run weekly growth experiments:** New channel, new CTA, pricing test, etc.
- [ ] **Content loop or sales loop:** Choose one and run it hard
- [ ] **User segmentation:** Know which segment converts + sticks

**Stage 3 Checkpoint (Gate):**
‚úÖ NSM tracked and growing weekly
‚úÖ 3-5 growth experiments/month
‚úÖ 10+ retained paying users
‚úÖ CAC:LTV math works on a napkin

**üö´ Kill or pivot if:** Users convert but churn. CAC is opaque or scaling burns margin. Growth is founder-only.

---

### Stage 4: Scale-Ready Execution & Monetization
**Goal:** You have a product, a channel, a funnel, and a business.

**Must-Do Tasks:**
- [ ] **Scalable channel:** One channel works (SEO, affiliates, outbound, etc.)
- [ ] **Pricing ‚Üí ARPU/expansion:** Add-ons, upsells, annuals
- [ ] **Unit economics:** 60%+ gross margin, CAC < LTV/3
- [ ] **Hire selectively:** First GTM, support, then infra (no full stack team bloat)
- [ ] **Reduce founder ops:** Delegate support, onboarding, GTM

**Stage 4 Checkpoint (Gate):**
‚úÖ Scalable acquisition + retention combo
‚úÖ 80%+ infra costs mapped + managed
‚úÖ 2-3 hires own core ops
‚úÖ You can walk away for 1 week without it collapsing

**üö´ Kill or freeze if:** Scaling burns cash without margin. Churn wipes out growth. Infra or support = bottleneck.
