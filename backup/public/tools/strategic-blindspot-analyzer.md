## Strategic Blindspot Risk Assessment

Based on your analysis, your strategic blindspot risk level is:

‚úÖ **Low Risk:** Well-validated strategy, strong external validation, systematic blindspot monitoring [ ]  
üü° **Medium Risk:** Some unvalidated assumptions, needs better monitoring and external input [ ]  
üü† **High Risk:** Multiple unvalidated assumptions, weak external validation, limited monitoring [ ]  
üî¥ **Critical Risk:** Major strategic assumptions unvalidated, no external validation, high exposure [ ]

*This tool helps you systematically identify and address strategic blindspots before they become business-critical risks, ensuring more robust and validated strategic decision-making.*
