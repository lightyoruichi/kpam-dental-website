# N8N Automation Templates Prompt
*Build ready-to-use automation workflows that connect your tools and scale your operations*

---

## üéØ What You'll Discover

You'll create specific N8N automation templates that eliminate 5-10 hours of manual work per week and ensure no leads or customers fall through the cracks. This matters because most businesses lose 20-30% of potential revenue due to manual processes and poor tool integration.

## üìä Data Sources to Check

**Current Tool Stack:**
- CRM system (HubSpot, Salesforce, Pipedrive)
- Email marketing platform (Mailchimp, ConvertKit, ActiveCampaign)
- Communication tools (Slack, Discord, Microsoft Teams)
- Analytics and tracking tools (Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel)

**Manual Processes:**
- Tasks your team does repeatedly (data entry, notifications, follow-ups)
- Information that gets copied between different tools
- Alerts or updates that you manually send or check

**Workflow Pain Points:**
- Data that exists in one tool but not others
- Manual follow-up sequences or reminders
- Reporting that requires pulling data from multiple sources

---

## üìù Data Collection Steps

**Step 1: Workflow Audit (15 minutes)**
1. List your 5 most time-consuming manual tasks
2. Note which tools you use and how data flows between them
3. Identify where information gets lost or delayed
4. Map your current lead/customer journey from first touch to close
5. Count how many times data gets manually entered in different systems

**Step 2: Integration Opportunity Mapping (10 minutes)**
1. Check which tools have N8N connectors (browse N8N app directory)
2. Note where you currently copy/paste data between tools
3. Identify notification gaps (when things happen but no one knows)
4. List follow-up sequences that happen manually
5. Find reporting tasks that require manual data compilation

**Step 3: Workflow Priority Assessment (10 minutes)**
1. Estimate time savings for each automation opportunity
2. Rate impact on customer experience (High/Medium/Low)
3. Assess setup complexity (Simple/Moderate/Complex)
4. Identify quick wins (high impact, low complexity)
5. Note workflows that directly impact revenue or retention
