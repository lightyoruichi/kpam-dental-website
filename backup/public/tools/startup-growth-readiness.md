## Example Growth Readiness Output

### Diagnosis: Fix Retention First
**Current State:** Your startup has achieved initial product-market fit but retention is declining after 30 days, indicating users aren't finding lasting value.

**Critical Blockers:**
1. **Magic Moment Too Slow:** Users take 14 days to reach value (target: 7 days)
2. **Weak Marginal User Experience:** Bottom 50% of users churn within 30 days
3. **Unclear North Star:** Team is optimizing for 3 different metrics

**Immediate Action Plan:**

**Week 1-2: Retention Foundation**
- [ ] Map user journey to identify magic moment
- [ ] Simplify onboarding to reach magic moment in 7 days
- [ ] Set single North Star metric and align team

**Month 1: User Experience Fixes**
- [ ] A/B test onboarding flows
- [ ] Implement targeted notifications for marginal users
- [ ] Create resurrection campaigns for churned users

**Month 2: Growth Engine Setup**
- [ ] Build SEO foundation for high-intent keywords
- [ ] Set up experiment tracking and weekly cadence
- [ ] Validate CAC:LTV before scaling paid channels

### Success Metrics to Track
- **Magic Moment Speed:** Target 7 days (currently 14 days)
- **D30 Retention:** Target 40% (currently 25%)
- **North Star Growth:** Weekly improvement in primary metric
- **Experiment Velocity:** 4+ experiments per month

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**1. Scaling Before PMF**
- **Mistake:** Spending on paid acquisition before retention proven
- **Fix:** Focus on retention until D30 > 40%

**2. Multiple North Stars**
- **Mistake:** Team optimizing for different metrics
- **Fix:** Single North Star, kill all other metrics

**3. Ignoring Marginal Users**
- **Mistake:** Only optimizing for power users
- **Fix:** Focus on weakest 50% of users

**4. Slow Experiment Velocity**
- **Mistake:** Perfect experiments that take months
- **Fix:** Ship imperfect tests in 7-14 days

**5. Founder-Led Growth Too Long**
- **Mistake:** CEO doing all growth work
- **Fix:** Build systems, delegate execution
