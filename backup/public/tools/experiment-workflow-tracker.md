# Experiment Board & Workflow Tracker Prompt
*Build a systematic approach to growth experiments with collaborative tracking and results*

---

## 🎯 What You'll Discover

You'll create a structured experiment management system that increases your growth testing success rate by 60-80% through better hypothesis formation, execution tracking, and results analysis. This matters because most businesses run random tests instead of systematic experiments that build on each other to compound growth.
